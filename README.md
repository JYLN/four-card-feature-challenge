## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [TailwindCSS][tailwinddocs]
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/docs) - for simple static site building

### What I learned

I never really use CSS Grid for layouts. Generally, I've been pretty happy with trying to negotiate flexbox for creating my layouts. This time I wanted to challenge myself to use grid and flexbox to create the layout from the design. Trying to center the outer card columns vertically was difficult but after I practiced grid by playing [Mastery Games - Grid Critters][gridcritters], I was able to transfer the knowledge to Tailwind utility classes and center the outer columns.

### Continued development

Building this project using both flexbox and grid was not nearly as difficult as I thought it would be. That may be the result of actually practicing grid before jumping into this challenge, but ultimately, I want to keep using the combination of flexbox and grid to build layouts because doing so will help keep my markup fairly clean.
